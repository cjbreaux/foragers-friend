# Forager's Friend

This application will allow mushroom hunters to capture and track the results of their hauls.

## Planning

| Time Block | Findings  |
|------------|-----------|
| 8am - 10am | Spent some time this morning furthering my understanding of Redux as I know I will want to use it in my project. Continued reading this guide: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-redux-the-worlds-easiest-guide-to-beginning-redux-c695f45546f6      |
| 10am- 12pm | Research on the availability of mushroom species APIs.  Found a JSON file at https://github.com/ahmadassaf/KBE/blob/master/results/dbpedia/Fungus.json Could host it myself on a firebase account or hard-code it into the app. Also, reached out to the webmaster at mushroomobserver.org and asked permission to access their API. Hoping to hear back from them as their dataset includes both images and species descriptions. |
| 1pm-2pm    | Mockup ideas for site layout using Lunacy. Not nearly as nice as Sketch, but helpful for rough drafts and getting a feel for how I want the site to be structured.  |
| 3pm-4pm    | Exploring visualization libraries. It looks like D3 is the more robust library but that also comes with increased complexity(and steeper learning curve) for implementation on this project. Chart.js looks more straightforward from the documentation. Need to build out a small test app to get a better sense for how it works. |
| 4pm-5pm    | Received the API documentation from MO and spent some time making GET requests to their servers with Postman. They have several endpoints and a large dataset but I'm still unsure of how best to implement it. |
